            <p>Yes, we have 3 vets that specialize in different pets, from cats to parrots and
                exotic animals. Still, we're not a vet clinic, so our vets provide only
                consultations and do not perform any procedures.</p>

            <p> Sure, if you need a pet sitter just once, you can order such a service. Also, you
                can request a pet sitter for 1-2 hours and decide whether you want to use our
                services later.</p>
