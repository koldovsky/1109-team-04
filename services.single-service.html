                            <p>If you have any questions or issues with your pet, we will be happy to advise you. We have three professional and certified veterinary physicians in Best.Pet.</p>
                            <p>All of them have huge on-hands experience with different species of animals, from usual pets to the most exotic animals.</p>

                            <p>Since Best.Pet is not a clinic, we mainly provide only consulting services and can give prescriptions for tests or special procedures or prescribe meds. However, we do not carry out any procedures at Best.Pet. We consult the owners of such pets:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cats and dogs of all breeds;</li>
                                <li>Guinea pigs, hamsters, and other rodents;</li>
                                <li>All species of birds, from parrots to canaries;</li>
                                <li>Snails, turtles, and other reptiles;</li>
                                <li>Exotic pets like racoons, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <div class="consultations__text">
                        <p>If you notice that your pet has begun to behave differently, this is a reason to sign up for a vet consultation at Best.Pet. Symptoms may include lack of appetite, inertness, fever, and so on. Also, your pet may do some uncustomary things â€” for example, your cat may seem to be stressed, spoil your shoes, scratch doors, etc.</p>
                        <p>Remember that animals can't speak and are not able to tell humans that they don't feel well. Thus, you need to look after your pet, be attentive, and treat it like a child that will never grow up. If you have any doubts about your pet's wellbeing, contact our vet.</p>
